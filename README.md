# redfishMockupServer

## About

***redfishMockupServer*** is a short python 3.4+ program that can be copied into folder at top of any redfish mockup and can serve redfish requests on the specified IP/port.  As a server, it may receive GET, PATCH, POST and DELETE commands, and implements the SubmitTestEvent action.

## Usage

### Requirements

In order to use this tool, please install the "requests" and "grequests" package for Python3.

pip3 install requests
pip3 install grequests

or

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### To start the server:

* Copy the ***redfishMockupServer.py*** file to the the folder you want to execute it from.
* Use the `-D <mockupDir>` option to specify an absolute or relative path to the mockup dir from CWD.
* Use the `-T` option to tell mockup server to include response delay from the mockup time.json file.
* Use the `-t <responseTime>` option to change default delay in seconds to each response. Default is 0 seconds. Must be float or int.
* Use the `-X` or `--headers` option to tell mockup server to send headers. Loads from headers.json. If not, standard headers are sent.
* Use the `-s` option to specify SSL (HTTPS) protocol.
 * In order for the server to function, you must also specify `--cert` and `--key` files.
* Note that the mockup directory will normally start with `/redfish`:
 * `redfish` should be a sub-directory.
 * This is a "Tall Mockup" which includes `/redfish/v1` at the top of the mockup directory structure.
 * A "Short Mockup" does not include `/redfish/v1` at the top of the mockup tree.
 * If you wish to use a "Short Mockup", use the `-S` option.
* Make sure python version 3.4+ is in your path
* Run redfishMockupServer from your command shell, e.g.: `python redfishMockupServer.py [-D <mockupDir>]`
* Default hostname/IP is localhost: 127.0.0.1
* Default port is: 8000
* You can create multiple mockup servers running on different ports using the `-p` option.
* See **Options** section below for additional options.

### Options:

* `python redfishMockupServer.py -h` -- gives help usage and exits

* Usage:

```
usage: redfishMockupServer.py [-h] [-H HOST] [-p PORT] [-D DIR] [-E] [-X]
                              [-t TIME] [-T] [-s] [--cert CERT] [--key KEY]
                              [-S] [-P]

Serve a static Redfish mockup.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -H HOST, --host HOST, --Host HOST
                        hostname or IP address (default 127.0.0.1)
  -p PORT, --port PORT, --Port PORT
                        host port (default 8000)
  -D DIR, --dir DIR, --Dir DIR
                        path to mockup dir (may be relative to CWD)
  -E, --test-etag, --TestEtag
                        (unimplemented) etag testing
  -X, --headers         load headers from headers.json files in mockup
  -t TIME, --time TIME  delay in seconds added to responses (float or int)
  -T                    delay response based on times in time.json files in
                        mockup
  -s, --ssl             place server in SSL (HTTPS) mode; requires a cert and
                        key
  --cert CERT           the certificate for SSL
  --key KEY             the key for SSL
  -S, --short-form, --shortForm
                        apply short form to mockup (omit filepath /redfish/v1)
  -P, --ssdp            make mockup SSDP discoverable
```

* `redfishMockupServer [-H *HostIpAddress* ] [-D <mockupDir>] [-H <host>] [-p <port>] [-T] [-t <responseTime>] [-X] [-E]`
  * default *HostIpAddress* is 127.0.0.1
  * default *port*         is 8000
  * *mockupDir* is absolute or relative to CWD if starting with . or ..
  * -T option causes mockup server to include delay in reponse. Loads from time.json . If not, looks up the default delay time.
  * `-t <responseTime>` tells the mockup server to add `<responseTime>` default delay to each response.  Default is 0 sec. Must be float or int
  * `-X` or `--headers` tells the mockup server to send headers from headers.json file
* Example:    
 * Start another service on port 8001 from folder _./MyServerMockup9_:
`python redfishMockupServer.py -p 8001 -D ./MyServerMockup9`
