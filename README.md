# Redfish Mockup Server

Copyright 2016-2020 DMTF. All rights reserved.

## About

The Redfish Mockup Server serves Redfish requests against a Redfish mockup.  The server runs at either a specified IP address and port or the default IP address and port, `127.0.0.1:8000`.

You can find DMTF-published sample mockups at [All Published Versions of DSP2043](https://www.dmtf.org/dsp/DSP2043 "https://www.dmtf.org/dsp/DSP2043").

To create a mockup from a service, use the [Redfish-Mockup-Creator](https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Mockup-Creator "https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Mockup-Creator").

The scope of this tool is to serve a static mockup for development purposes.  It does support modification requests, such as `PATCH` and `POST`, and actions to a limited extent.  For a more feature-rich Redfish experience, one of the following tools can be used instead of the Redfish Mockup Server:

* [Redfish-Interface-Emulator](https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Interface-Emulator): A more functional service that implements modification requests and actions.
* [Swordfish-API-Emulator](https://github.com/SNIA/Swordfish-API-Emulator): A SNIA extension to the previous tool with more built-in functionality supported.

## Requirements

To run the mockup server natively on your system:

* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "https://www.python.org/downloads/") and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ "https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing").
* Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the mockup server as a Docker container:

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started "https://www.docker.com/get-started").

                        (unimplemented) etag testing
  -X, --headers         load headers from headers.json files in mockup
  -t TIME, --time TIME  delay in seconds added to responses (float or int)
  -T                    delay response based on times in time.json files in
                        mockup
  -s, --ssl             place server in SSL (HTTPS) mode; requires a cert and
                        key
  --cert CERT           the certificate for SSL
  --key KEY             the key for SSL
  -S, --short-form, --shortForm
                        apply short form to mockup (omit filepath /redfish/v1)
  -P, --ssdp            make mockup SSDP discoverable
```

### Description

The mockup server starts an HTTP server at the `-H HOST` host and `-p PORT` port. The mockup server provides Redfish resources in the `-D DIR` mockup directory.

If the mockup does not contain the representation of the `/redfish` resource, you must provide the `--short-form` argument. If you omit the mockup, the mockup server serves DMTF's `public-rackmount1` mockup.

### Native system example

```bash
python redfishMockupServer.py -D /home/user/redfish-mockup
```

### Docker container example

To run as a Docker container, use one of these actions to pull or build the container:

* Pull the container from Docker Hub:

    ```bash
    docker pull dmtf/redfish-mockup-server:latest
    ```
* Build a container from local source:

    ```bash
    docker build -t dmtf/redfish-mockup-server:latest .
    ```
* Build a container from GitHub:

    ```bash
    docker build -t dmtf/redfish-mockup-server:latest https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Mockup-Server.git
    ```

This command runs the container with the built-in `public-rackmount1` mockup:

```bash
docker run --rm dmtf/redfish-mockup-server:latest
```

This command runs the container with a specified mockup, where `<path-to-mockup>` is the path to the mockup directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -v <path-to-mockup>:/mockup dmtf/redfish-mockup-server:latest -D /mockup
```

Or using compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```
